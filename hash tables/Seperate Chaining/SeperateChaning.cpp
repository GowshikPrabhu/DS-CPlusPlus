/*
* Create a hash function, such that our hash table has ‘N’ number of buckets.
* To insert a node into the hash table, we need to find the hash index for the given key. And it
* could be calculated using the hash function. Use seperate chaining for collision.
* Example: hashIndex = key % noOfBuckets
